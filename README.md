# martian-io

A top-down Modd.io sandbox game inspired by Outpost 2, Stronghold, Istanbul, Century, and Splendor about building settlements on Mars.

Solitary play:

Every day the server restarts, builders are sent to the next building site, with no buildings at all, only some containers of building materials and tools scattered around them. Players have to explore the map and take what they find to the stockpile while upgrading their methods with the tools. The player who brings in the most valuable materials will be promoted to foreman, once there is enough materials to build an HQ. Containers are far enough to let players explore alone.

Parallel play:

Once the HQ is built, the foreman chooses the next project. Players will take the necessary materials from the stockpile to the next building, next to each other. Once again, the best one will be rewarded. Exploration is still allowed to increase the stockpile and get points for rewards.

Ambient coop:

Further buildings are built the same way, early ones usually producing new material types. Rewards give bonus the everyone: rails to increase speed, generators for energy.
