# martian-io

A Modd.io game inspired top-down trading game by Outpost 2, Istanbul, Century, and Splendor about building settlements on Mars.

Solitary play:

Every day the server restarts, builders are sent to the next building site, with no buildings at all, only some containers of building materials and tools scattered around them. Players have to explore the map and take what they find to the stockpile while upgrading their methods with the tools. The player who brings in the most valuable materials will be promoted to foreman, once there is enough materials to build an HQ.
